👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Lando
🌍 Software Engineer | Open-Source Enthusiast | Problem Solver

I’m a passionate developer building projects across HTML, TypeScript, Python, and C++. My GitHub showcases a mix of creative experiments and real-world tooling — from interactive web builds to AI-assisted bots and game engines.

⭐️ I enjoy learning new technologies, contributing to open source, and turning ideas into code. Whether working with game logic, utilities, or algorithmic tools, I aim for clean, thoughtful engineering and practical solutions.

🔭 Highlights

Developed full-stack and frontend projects like cars, figma-website, and chessai

Built Python utilities including reddit bots and experimental tools

Explored systems-level and image format work with a fork of libjxl

Actively explore new frameworks, libraries, and programming patterns

💡 I’m always open to collaboration, feedback, and new challenges — let’s build something awesome!
